Sequences are ordered sets of objects indexed by non-ngative integers

* `str` : Sequences of chars; immutable
* `list` : Sequences of arbitary objects
* `tuple` : Sequences of arbitary objects; immutable
* `range` : immutable

For immutable types, any operation will only return a value (rather than actually change the value).

| Method | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `len(s)` | Number of elements in `s` |
| `min(s, [,default=obj, key=func])` | The min value in `s` (alphabetically for strings) |
| `max(s, [,default=obj, key=func])` | Max value in `s` (alphabetically for strings) |
| `sum(s, [, start=0])` | The sum of the elements (returns `TypeError` is `s` is not numeric |
| `all(s)` | Returns `True` if all elements in `s` are True (i.e., not `0`, `False` or `Null` |
| `any(s)` | Checks whether any item in `s` is `True` |

In addition, all sequences support the following operations

| Method | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `s+r` | Concats two sequences of the same type |
| `s * r` | Make `n` copies of `s`, where `n` is an integer |
| `v1, v2, ..., vn = s` | Unpacks `n` variables from `s` to `v1`, `v2` and so on |
| `s[i]` | Indexing-returns element `i` of `s` |
| `s[i:j:stride]` | Slicing returns elements between `i` and `j` with optional stride |
| `x in s` | Returns `True` if element `x` is in `s` |
| `x not in s` | Returns `True` if element `x` is not in `s` |
