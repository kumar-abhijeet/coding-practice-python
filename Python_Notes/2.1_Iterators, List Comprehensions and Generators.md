## Iterators

Repeating a similar calculation, over and over, in an automated fashion.

1. `range()` iterator

```
for i in range(10):
  print(i, end=' ')

#Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

In Python 3, `range` is not a _list_, but is sometimes called an _iterator_

2. Iterating over Lists / Sequence data types

`for x in y` syntax: repeat some operation for each value in the list _for [each] value in the [list]_

3. `enumerate`

Use: When we want to iterate not only the **values** in an array, but also keep track of the **index**

```
L  = [2,3,6,8]

for i, val in enumerate(L):
  print(i, val)

#Output:
0 2
1 4
2 6
3 8
```

4. `zip`

Use: When we want to iterate over **multiple lists** simultaneously. 

Any number of iterables can be zipped together. If they are of different lengths, the shortest will determine the length of the zip.

```
L = [2, 4, 6, 8]
R = [3, 6, 9, 12]

for lval, rval in zip(L,R):
  print(lval, rval)
```

5. `map` and `filter`

`map` use: this iterator takes a function and applies it to the values in an iterator

```
# find the first 10 square numbers
square = lambda x: x ** 2

for val in map(square, range(10)):
  print(val, end = ' ')

#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81
```

`filter` use: this iterator only passes through values for which the filter function evaluates to `True`

```
# find values upto 10 for which x % 2 is zero

is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
for val in filter(is_even, range(10)):
  print(val, end = ' ')

#output: 0 2 4 6 8
```

_there is `reduce` as well. not often used_

## List Comprehensions

Basic syntax: ` [ expr for var in iterable ] `

Read as: Construct a List consisting of the square of n (`expr`) `for` each `n` (`var`) up to `12` (`iterable`).

1. **Basic List Comprehension**

Simple way to compress a list-building `for` loop into a single short, readable line.

```
#loop that constructs a list of the 1st 12 square integers

[ n**2 for n in range(12) ]
#Output: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]
```

2. **Multiple Iteration**

When we want to build a list not just from 1 value, but from two

```
[ (i,j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3) ]

#Output: [ (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) ]
```

* The second expression acts as the interior index, varying the fastest in the resulting list
* Can be extended to 3,4, or more iterators within comprehension

3. **Conditionals on the Iterator**

**add a conditional to the end of the expression**

Basic syntax: ` [ expr for var in iterable if conditional_expr ] `

```
# construct a list of values for each value upto 20, but only if the val is not divisible by 3

[ val for val in range(20) if val % 3 > 0 ]
#Output: [1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16,17,19]
```

4. **Conditionals on the Value**

This technique can be used within list comprehensions, `lambda` functions, and other places where a simple expression is desired

```
# construct a list, leaving out multiples of 3, and negating all multiples of 2

[ val if val%2 else -val
  for val in range(20) if val%3 ] #line break here is valid for better readability

#Output: [1,-2,-4,5,7,-8,-10,11,13,-14,-16,17,19]
```

---

### Other Types of Comprehensions

**Set Comprehensions**

```
{ n**2 for n in range(12) }
#Output: {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121}
```

Note that Set is a collection that contains no duplicates. Set Comprehension respect this rule, and elimiate any duplicate entries

```
{ a%3 for a in range(1000) }
#Output: {0,1,2}
```

**Dict Comprehension**

```
{ n:n**2 for n in range(6) }
#Output: { 0:0, 1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25 }
```

**Generator Expression**

Covered in the next section

## Generators

Two types: **Generator Expressions** and **Generator Functions**

Difference between Geneator Expressions and List Comprehensions?

1. List Comprehensions use [ ], Generator Expressions use ( )

```
# this is a list comprehension
[n ** 2 for n in range(12)]
Output: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]

#this is a generator expression
(n**2 for n in range(12))
Output: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x104a60518>
```
Printing of Generator Expression doesn't print the contents; one way to print the contents of a generator expression is to pass it to a `list` constructor

2. A List is a collection of values, while a generator is a recipe for producing values

```
# both expose the same iterator interface

# memory cost associated
L = [n**2 for n in range(12)]
for val in L:
  print(val, end=' ')
# output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121

#doesn't actually compute the values until it is needed. so size of generator expression is unlimited
G = (n**2 for n in range(12))
for val in G:
  print(val, end=' ')
# output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
```

3. A list can be iterated multiple times; a generator expression is single use

```
L = [n**2 for n in range(12)]

for val in L:
  print(val, end=' ')
print()

for val in L:
  print(val, end=' ')

#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
```

A generator expression is used up after one iteration

```
G = (n**2 for n in range(12))
list(G)

#output: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]

list(G)
#output: []
```

---

#### Generator Functions: Using yield

A list comprehension is best to create relatively simple lists, while using a normal `for` loop is better in more complicated situations.

```
# two ways of constructing the same list

L1 = [n**2 for n in range(12)]

L2 = []
for n in range(12):
  L2.append(n**2)

print(L1)
print(L2)

#output1: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]
#output2: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]
```

Same is true for Generator Expressions.

We can make more complicated generators using _generator functions_ , which make use of the **yield** statement

```
# two ways of constructing equivalent generators:

G1 = (n**2 for n in range(12))

def gen():
  for n in range(12):
    yield n**2

G2 = gen()

print(*G1)
#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
print(*G2)
#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
```

A generator function is a function, that rather than using `return` to return a value once, uses `yield` to yield a (potentially infinite) sequence of values.

Just as in generator expressions, the state of the generator is preserved between partial iterations, but if we want a fresh copy of the generator we can simply call the function again
