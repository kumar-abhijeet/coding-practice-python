## Iterators



## List Comprehensions


## Generators

Two types: **Generator Expressions** and **Generator Functions**

Difference between Geneator Expressions and List Comprehensions?

1. List Comprehensions use [ ], Generator Expressions use ( )

```
# this is a list comprehension
[n ** 2 for n in range(12)]
Output: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]

#this is a generator expression
(n**2 for n in range(12))
Output: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x104a60518>
```
Printing of Generator Expression doesn't print the contents; one way to print the contents of a generator expression is to pass it to a `list` constructor

2. A List is a collection of values, while a generator is a recipe for producing values

```
# both expose the same iterator interface

# memory cost associated
L = [n**2 for n in range(12)]
for val in L:
  print(val, end=' ')
# output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121

#doesn't actually compute the values until it is needed. so size of generator expression is unlimited
G = (n**2 for n in range(12))
for val in G:
  print(val, end=' ')
# output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
```

3. A list can be iterated multiple times; a generator expression is single use

```
L = [n**2 for n in range(12)]

for val in L:
  print(val, end=' ')
print()

for val in L:
  print(val, end=' ')

#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
```

A generator expression is used up after one iteration

```
G = (n**2 for n in range(12))
list(G)

#output: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]

list(G)
#output: []
```

---

#### Generator Functions: Using yield

A list comprehension is best to create relatively simple lists, while using a normal `for` loop is better in more complicated situations.

```
# two ways of constructing the same list

L1 = [n**2 for n in range(12)]

L2 = []
for n in range(12):
  L2.append(n**2)

print(L1)
print(L2)

#output1: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]
#output2: [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121]
```

Same is true for Generator Expressions.

We can make more complicated generators using _generator functions_ , which make use of the **yield** statement

```
# two ways of constructing equivalent generators:

G1 = (n**2 for n in range(12))

def gen():
  for n in range(12):
    yield n**2

G2 = gen()

print(*G1)
#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
print(*G2)
#output: 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121
```

A generator function is a function, that rather than using `return` to return a value once, uses `yield` to yield a (potentially infinite) sequence of values.

Just as in generator expressions, the state of the generator is preserved between partial iterations, but if we want a fresh copy of the generator we can simply call the function again
